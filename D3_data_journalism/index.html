          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
          <p>There is a strong positive relationship between in Poverty (%) and Lacks Healthcare (%).  
            Values in Poverty (%) range from 9% to 22%.  Conversly, Lacks Healthcare (%) vs. 
            Household Income (Median) shows a slight negative relationship.  
            As expected, the higher the median household income, the lower the percent lacking healthcare.</p>

          <p>There is a strong positive relationship between percent of smokers and in Poverty (%).  
            Conversly, median incomes between 40,000 and 55,000 the data shows a 
            strong negative relationship between percent smokers and median household income.  
            However, once a median household income of 55,000 is reached, 
            there appears to be a leaveling off of the percent smokers.  
            In this range, the percent smokers stabilizes between 13%-22% (with 1 outlier at 10%)</p>

          <p>There is a weak positive relationship between percent obese and in Poverty (%).  
            Conversly, there is a weak negative relationship between percent obese and median household income.</p>

          <p>Plots against median age do not show a strong or weak relationship 
            with percent obese, percent smokers, or percent lacking healthcare.  
            Median ages range between 30 and 44.</p>
